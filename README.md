# Lost Found

This is an application that scans QR codes in stickers that users put into their belongings. After someones finds the lost belonging, they can scan the code and that will provide them with an interface to communicate with the owner, no privacy issues are violated, just anonymous chatting. How the item returns to the owner is in the user and the founder.
